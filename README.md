This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It was then 'ejected' by: `npm run eject` and modified to support more than one entry point with the entry point 
configuration being set in the config/entrypoints.json file.

Start the application by running the `npm start` command in the project directory. 

This will run the application in development mode and open the page as configured in entrypoints.json file.
